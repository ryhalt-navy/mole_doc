# **Mole**

![License (CC0)](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0--1.0-brightgreen)

Mole is a tool to assist with testing and experimentation involving robots and unmanned systems. Is can support test and experiment execution, data collection, analysis, and reporting.  This documentation attempts to provide sufficient background to enable using Mole or contributing to its development.

## **Requirements**
1) Docker

Add docker apt repository, install Docker, create `docker` group and add the user to it, then start the service. See [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    $ echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

    $ sudo groupadd docker
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    $ sudo service docker start
Reboot, then confirm docker is running.
    
    $ docker run hello-world

2) docker-compose

Install Docker-Compose locally, set permissions, and modify the path. See [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

    $ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

Confirm that docker-compose is installed

    $ docker-compose --version

3) openssl


In order for Mole to automatically generate keys/certificates for https, the `openssl` command must be installed on the host. This is normally the case by default.


## **Documentation**

Documentation is available at https://niwcpac.github.io/mole/

Documentation can also be built and served locally using the `ml` script at the root of the Mole repo. The `ml` script can be used to build containers, start services, populate dbs, stop services, or build and serve documentation.  It is structured with a number of commands.  Additional help on each command 
can be found by passing the `-h` flag.  E.g., `./ml run -h`.

The following command will serve Mole documentation locally at [http://localhost/docs/](http://localhost/docs/):

    $ ./ml docs
