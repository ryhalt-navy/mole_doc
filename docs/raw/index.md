# **Welcome to Mole**

Mole is a tool to assist with execution, data collection, analysis, and reporting for testing and experimentation involving unmanned systems.  This documentation attempts to provide sufficient background to enable using Mole or contributing to its development.

Mole originated as a way to collect data for unmanned ground vehicles and to automatically generate reports with summary metrics and figures.  It now finds a number of additional use cases spanning single and multi-vehicle operations within air, ground, and sea domains.
