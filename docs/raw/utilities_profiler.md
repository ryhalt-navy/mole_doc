# **Profiler**

Mole includes the [Silk](https://github.com/jazzband/django-silk) profiling tool that can be run with the `--profile` flag on the `./ml init` and `./ml run` commands. When Mole is run with the `--profile` flag, Silk is available at [http://localhost/silk/](http://localhost/silk/) or [http://localhost:8000/silk/](http://localhost:8000/silk/)

!!! tip "Note"
    It is not recommended to run the Silk profiler in an operational context.

From the project's documentation: 
> Silk is a live profiling and inspection tool for the Django framework. Silk intercepts and stores HTTP requests and database queries before presenting them in a user interface for further inspection.
> It records things like:
>
> * Time taken
> * Num. queries
> * Time spent on queries
> * Request/Response headers
> * Request/Response bodies

### SQL Query Inspection
> Silk also intercepts SQL queries that are generated by each request. We can get a summary on things like the tables involved, number of joins and execution time (the table can be sorted by clicking on a column header)

### Function Profiling
> Silk can also be used to profile specific blocks of code/functions. It provides a decorator and a context manager for this purpose.

Silk has an option to generate binary `.prof` files for more in depth profiling information.  These files can be viewed in tools like [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) or other cProfile tools.  This option is off by default in Mole because it rapidly fills the `mole/media/` directory with `.prof` files. It can be enabled by uncommenting the line

        # SILKY_PYTHON_PROFILER_BINARY = True

in `mole/mole/settings/settings.py`.
